1.	Find all employees whose first names start with a vowel and whose last names end with a consonant.

SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE LEFT(first_name, 1) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') 
AND RIGHT(last_name, 1) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');

2.	For each department, display the total salary expenditure, the average salary, and the highest salary. Use window functions to calculate the total, average, and max salary, but show each result for all employees in that department.

SELECT 
    e.department_id, 
    d.department_name, 
    e.employee_id, 
    e.first_name, 
    e.last_name, 
    e.salary, 
    SUM(e.salary) OVER (PARTITION BY e.department_id) AS total_salary, 
    AVG(e.salary) OVER (PARTITION BY e.department_id) AS avg_salary, 
    MAX(e.salary) OVER (PARTITION BY e.department_id) AS max_salary 
FROM employees e 
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

3.	Write a query that fetches the following.All employees, their department name, their manager’s name (if they have one), and their salary.

SELECT 
    e.employee_id, 
    e.first_name AS employee_first_name, 
    e.last_name AS employee_last_name, 
    d.department_name, 
    m.first_name AS manager_first_name, 
    m.last_name AS manager_last_name, 
    e.salary 
FROM employees e 
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id 
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

4.	Create a query using a recursive CTE to list all employees and their respective reporting chains (i.e., list the manager’s manager and so on).

WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS ( 
    SELECT 
        employee_id, 
        first_name, 
        last_name, 
        manager_id, 
        0 AS level 
    FROM employees 
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL 
    UNION ALL 
    SELECT 
        e.employee_id, 
        e.first_name, 
        e.last_name, 
        e.manager_id, 
        eh.level + 1 
    FROM employees e 
    JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id 
) 
SELECT * 
FROM employee_hierarchy;

5.	Write a query to fetch the details of employees earning above a certain salary threshold.

SELECT 
    employee_id, 
    first_name, 
    last_name, 
    department_id, 
    salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > 40000;
